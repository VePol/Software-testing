> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- This experience was very educative as it gave the opportunity to try a real-life scenario. Also, I'm more aware of what should be taken in consideration when software testing. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

- I started by trying out the pages mentioned in the PageObject folder. And through that and with the given instructions indentified all the requirments and variables.
With the provided materials I could identify the necessary tasks for the testing. 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 

 -    Some of the tools styles where reviewed in the course materials. This assignment examples was simple and good enought to grasp the overall intention.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- I used Visual Studio Code as it was already familiar to me.


## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- At first I found the instructions a bit unclear or it took some time to comprehend the big picture. But I just reviewed the materials and instructions thoroughly.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- GitHub is still a bit unfamiliar to me, but lately I have gotten to use it in various courses. The use of it is becoming always easier. 
 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- Maybe Cypress would be an option. It should be user-friendly and compatible with JavaScript. 


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- Analytical skills
- Good learner
- Attention to detail
- Team worker
- Coding
- AI and machine learning


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

- I could always improve in coding and AI/machine learning
- With soft skills I'm at a good point, but often in team works I get the "team leader" role. Some think it's being bossy, for me it's getting things done. I try to take everyone in consideration, but might sometimes fale as I work fulltime and have a tight schedule. Hopefully I can improve when I'm just working and have finished my studies. 

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

- This was a really nice hands-on assignment.
It would be easier to have visual videos in the course materials. ALso, some more lectures would be useful. Thank you!
